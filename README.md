# Star Wars CLI (swcli)

This CLI allows you to query the Star Wars API from your command line. So far, it only allows you to look up resources by id.

## Resources

    - films
    - people
    - planets
    - species
    - starships
    - vehicles

To look up a film, for example, you type:

```
swcli films 2
```

The json response will print in your terminal.
